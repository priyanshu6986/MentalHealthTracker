Mental Health Fitness Tracker

This project implements a data-driven application designed to track and improve users' mental well-being. It combines machine learning algorithms with visualizations to deliver personalized recommendations for stress management, anxiety reduction, and overall mental health enhancement.

Getting Started

Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have the required libraries installed using pip:

pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib plotly scikit-learn
Run the application:

Clone this repository and execute the provided code to load data and train the machine learning models.

Project Structure

data: This folder likely stores the datasets used in the project (mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease.csv and prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv).
scripts: This folder might contain Python scripts for data processing, model training, and visualization generation.
README.md (This file) - Provides project overview and usage instructions.
requirements.txt (Optional) - This file can list the project's dependencies for easy installation using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Further Customization

Feel free to modify and customize the code within the scripts folder to suit your specific needs and target audience.

Machine Learning Models

The project employs two machine learning models:

Linear Regression: Identifies linear relationships between input features (e.g., sleep patterns, stress levels) and mental health outcomes (e.g., mood fluctuations, anxiety levels).
Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to capture non-linear relationships between features and outcomes, enhancing prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation

The performance of both models is evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared on training and testing datasets.

Disclaimer

This Mental Health Fitness Tracker is a prototype and should not replace professional mental health advice or treatment. It serves as a tool to raise awareness and promote better mental well-being.
